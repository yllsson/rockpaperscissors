// insert game here...

/* this is how the game should flow:

  user presses button to start game

  user picks rock/paper/scissors 

  using Math.random to generate random number b/w 0 and 1
  
  if or switch-statement --> 
    if math.random is up to 0.33 - rock, 
    if b/w 0.34-0.66 - paper, 
    if 0.67 or higher - scissors

  alert or add div/text of some kind to say "you win" or "you lose"

  add score keeping mechanism... maybe best of 3 or first to 5 wins?

  add functionality to add their name to a leader board?
